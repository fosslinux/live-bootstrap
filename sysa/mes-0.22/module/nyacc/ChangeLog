2018-12-24  Matt Wette  <mwette@alumni.caltech.edu>

	* /: removed lalr2.scm

2018-11-21  Matt Wette  <mwette@alumni.caltech.edu>

	* lex.scm (make-num-reader): support 0X (cap x) for hex numbers

2018-11-16  Matt Wette  <mwette@alumni.caltech.edu>

	* lang/sx-util.scm (sx-join): changed the way sx-split and sx-join
	work with repect to attributes, the attr returned from sx-split
	and passed to sx-join are the tails of '(@ (a "1") (b "2"))
	instead of the entire form.  One can pass '() or #f to sx-join.

2018-10-14  Matt Wette  <mwette@alumni.caltech.edu>

	* lang/sx-util.scm (sxm-node): cleaned up sx-match now accepts
	(,_ ...) to accept all, and supports string matching

2018-09-28  Matt Wette  <mwette@alumni.caltech.edu>

	* lang/sx-util.scm: added make-sx;

2018-09-23  Matt Wette  <mwette@alumni.caltech.edu>

	* lex.scm (make-comm-reader): For comment patterns ending with
	newline, when see eof-object should return match pair but was just
	returning the string (i.e., was "comment" now '($lone-comm "comment"))

2018-09-05  Matt Wette  <mwette@alumni.caltech.edu>

	* lalr.scm (process-spec): added alt-start spec attribute in order
	to prevent warning about unused LHS non-terminals; but not working

	* lalr.scm (drop-dot-new): new routine to replace string-sub
	and it's use; no dependence on (ice-9 regex) now

2018-08-19  Matt Wette  <mwette@alumni.caltech.edu>

	* lang/sx-util.scm: added sx-split, sx-split*, sx-join, sx-join*

2018-08-12  Matt Wette  <mwette@alumni.caltech.edu>

	* lex.scm (make-num-reader): for case (12) iter args swapped:
	fixed with "5 ba" => "ba 5"

2018-08-11  Matt Wette  <mwette@alumni.caltech.edu>

	* lang/sx-util.scm: removed sx+attr routines, added sx-attr-add
	and sx-attr-add*; updated c99/body.scm to use sx-attr-add

2018-07-29  Matt Wette  <mwette@alumni.caltech.edu>

	* lalr.scm (compact-machine): default for #:keep is now 0, was 3

	* parse.scm: reworked the parsers; instead of one for interactive
	and one for non-interative, with each handling unhashed (symbolic)
	or hashed (numberic), we now have one for symbolic and one for
	numeric with each handling interactive and non-interactive; I
	think this is now cleaner

	* lang/util.scm: removed dead sx- code; now in sx-util.scm;
	moved lang-dir, xtra-dir from lang/mach.scm files to here and
	renamed xtra-dir to mach-dir

2018-07-27  Matt Wette  <mwette@alumni.caltech.edu>

	* parse.scm: Removed dependence on srfi-43 by adding vector-map.

2018-07-25  Matt Wette  <mwette@alumni.caltech.edu>

	* lalr.scm (compact-machine): The default set of keepers is now
	($lone-comm $code-comm) and the requires keepers list was removed
	but $error is hardcoded as only required keeper.  I was having
	issues with the ia-parser/num because it looks for lone $default
	to reduce without lookahead.  I still need to think about this.

2018-07-12  Matt Wette  <mwette@alumni.caltech.edu>

	* parse.scm (make-lalr-ia-parser/num): broke make-lalr-ia-parser
	into make-lalr-ia-parser/sym for unhashed and
	make-lalr-ia-parser/num for hashed.  The /num version is working;
	need to recode the sym one still.

	* lalr.scm (compact-machine): removed $end from required-keepers;
	changed $default from -1 to 1 so that all token values are > 0.
	The pat-v could potentially now be a vector.

2018-07-09  Matt Wette  <mwette@alumni.caltech.edu>

	* lalr.scm (compact-machine): force $end to be -2, so parsers
	don't have to look up the value

	* parse.scm (make-lalr-ia-parser/num): added /sym and /num parsers;
	abandoning attempt to make general purpose parsers for hashed/unhashed

2018-05-12  Matt Wette  <mwette@alumni.caltech.edu>

	* lex.scm (make-lexer-generator): added extra keyword arg to
	handle extra reader.  This makes the lexer-generator a bit more
	flexible for non-C languages.
	(make-num-reader): update to read "12-3" as a float

2018-05-05  Matt Wette  <mwette@alumni.caltech.edu>

	* lang/util.scm: removed sx- routines; renamed sxml-util to
	sx-util; removed sx-match;  sx-match is now in sx-util

2018-03-28  Matt Wette  <mwette@alumni.caltech.edu>

	* lang/util.scm: sx-ref* now returns #f for non-usable xxx

2018-01-21  Matt Wette  <mwette@alumni.caltech.edu>

	* version.scm: release version 0.83.0

2017-11-23  Matt Wette  <mwette@alumni.caltech.edu>

	* lex.scm (read-c-chlit): did not parse '\177' correctly (prev
	code fix may have done this).  Fixed (I hope) and added test
	case for escapes in C chlit and C string in test-suite.

2017-11-12  Matt Wette  <mwette@alumni.caltech.edu>

	* lex.scm (read-oct): changed (read-oct ch) to (read-oct) to be
	consistent with (read-hex).

2017-11-11  Matt Wette  <mwette@alumni.caltech.edu>

	* lex.scm (read-c-chlit): removed (unread-char ch) for U but no '
	This bug was causingd janneke's tccpp.c to not parse.

2017-09-23  Matt Wette  <mwette@alumni.caltech.edu>

	* util.scm: updated ugly-print w/ new api similar to pretty-print

2017-09-10  Matt Wette  <mwette@alumni.caltech.edu>

	* util.scm (ugly-print): changed letrec to letrec*.  Not sure why
	this has been working forever and broke in install context.  Seems
	to work now.

2017-08-20  Matt Wette  <mwette@alumni.caltech.edu>

	* lex.scm (make-comm-reader): added option to remove prefix
	from comments; That is, for a multi-line comment that starts in
	column 10, spaces up to column 10 will be removed in following
	lines

2017-08-02  Matt Wette  <mwette@alumni.caltech.edu>

	* lex.scm (read-c-string): numeric escapes (e.g., \0) were
	not working due to use of ch instead of c1 in numeric check

2017-07-28  Matt Wette  <mwette@alumni.caltech.edu>

	* lex.scm (make-num-reader): bug report from janneke: c-parser
	is not parsing "0ULL".  the num reader has been updated (state 12)
	to handle this
	(cnumstr->scm): updated to trim ULL from 0ULL.

2017-06-29  Matt Wette  <mwette@alumni.caltech.edu>

	* lex.scm (make-chseq-reader): make robust to <eof>

2017-06-11  Matt Wette  <mwette@alumni.caltech.edu>

	* lex.scm (nyacc): make-ident-like-p tested for string but not for
	empty string: added `not eof-object?'

2017-06-03  Matt Wette  <mwette@alumni.caltech.edu>

	* lex.scm (read-c-chlit): added '\r' and '\|' moved '\\' to case

2017-05-28  Matt Wette  <mwette@alumni.caltech.edu>

	* lalr.scm (step4): added precedence for resolving RR conflicts!

2017-05-20  Matt Wette  <mwette@alumni.caltech.edu>

	* lalr.scm (lalr-spec): removed more with/prune syntax; added
	reserve directive for reserved terminals (e.g., "volatile")

2017-05-06  Matt Wette  <mwette@alumni.caltech.edu>

	* lalr.scm: updated write-lalr-tables and write-lalr-actions to
	accept a prefix string

2017-05-04  Matt Wette  <mwette@alumni.caltech.edu>

	* lang/util.scm (make-pp-formatter): fixed bug in column counting
	that prevented line-wrap to occur.

2017-04-12  Matt Wette  <mwette@alumni.caltech.edu>

	* lex.scm (make-comm-reader): comments which end in newline can
	now also end in #<eof>

2017-03-03  Matt Wette  <mwette@alumni.caltech.edu>

	* lalr.scm: added "keepers" keyword argument to compact-machine
	and also added $end as default

2017-01-08  Matt Wette  <mwette@alumni.caltech.edu>

	* ../../test-suite/nyacc/lang/c99/exam.d/ex05.c: C99 does not
	allow lone `;' outside of functions.  Removed.

2017-01-07  Matt Wette  <mwette@alumni.caltech.edu>

	* lang/util.scm: add report-error: prints msg w/ file, line

	* parse.scm (make-lalr-parser): changed printout of parse error to
	(throw 'parse-error . args) and expect the full parser to catch
	the error

2017-01-06  Matt Wette  <mwette@alumni.caltech.edu>

	* lalr.scm (process-spec): in add-el changed memq to member since
	we are using strings for terminals

2016-11-25  Matt Wette  <mwette@alumni.caltech.edu>

	* added support for ellipsis to lang/c99/cpp.scm

2016-11-24  Matt Wette  <mwette@alumni.caltech.edu>

	* added (ellipsis) to lang/c99/pprint.scm

2016-04-09  Matt Wette  <mwette@alumni.caltech.edu>

	* bison.scm: new file providing make-lalr-machin/bison.  It is
	similar to make-lalr-machine but uses external bison program
	instead of the default from-scratch lalr code.

2016-03-04  Matt Wette  <mwette@alumni.caltech.edu>

	* lalr.scm: changed grammar parser to interpret $string as
	terminal.  This saves typing a quote in front.
