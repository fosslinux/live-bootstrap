#+TITLE: Tentative GNU Mes Road Map

Copyright © 2016,2017,2018,2019 Jan (janneke) Nieuwenhuizen <janneke@gnu.org>

The goals of the GNU Mes project are two-fold:

  - to bootstrap the GNU System purely from source, without using any binary
    seeds.

  - to aid the Reproducible-Builds.org effort; demonstrate the impact and
    importance of GNU and Software Freedom.

Since its inception, the project has gone a long way towards that goal.  Below
is a list of items we want for version "1.0" of GNU Mes.

You're welcome to discuss this road map on bug-mes@gnu.org or #bootstrappable
on Freenode!

* TODO
** release 0.x, unsorted
  - Merge the Scheme-only bootstrap which uses Gash and Gash Core
    Utilities to remove from bootstrap-binary seed : Awk, Bash, Core
    Utilities, Grep, Gzip, Sed, Tar.
  - Introduce the Reduced Binaries Seed bootstrap to NixOS (Debian,
    Arch, Gentoo, ...?)
  - Full Source Bootstrap: compile mes.c using M2-Planet.  Jeremiah
    branched-out from mes; see https://github.com/oriansj/mes-m2, also see the
    branches: wip-full-source-bootstrap, wip-m2-merge and wip-m2.
  - Full Guile-compatible module support: define-module, define-public,
    export, use-modules, ...
  - ARMv7/AArch64 support: Mes C Library and MesCC.
  - Simplify eval-apply and other core functionality (see mes-m2).
  - Support native x86_64 bootstrap.
  - Simplify MesCC ``MesCC should optimize ease of convincing us of its
    correctness''
  - tcc: remove or upstream patches from tcc-boot.
  - tcc: build 0.9.27 directly instead of via 0.9.26, see tinycc
** after release 1.0
  - Build Guix packages using Mes: run or simplify (guix build utils),
    (guix build gnu-build-system).
  - Build Guix packages without guix-daemon.  See Ludovic's initrd build
    work.
  - Bootstrap support for the Hurd.  Most needed now are fork and exec.
  - Replace the initial gcc-2.95.3 with gcc-4.6.4.
  - FreeBSD, *BSD?
    wip-bootstrappable@0.9.27 branch
  - Skip tcc: Build gcc using MesCC.
  - better garbage collector.
  - mes/mescc: proper docstrings, api reference documentation.
  - mes/mescc: bootstrap a minimal Guile?
    + libguile/{eval,init,list,strings,values,..}.
    + ice-9/eval.scm
  - syntax-case bootstrap problem
    + resolve portable syntax-case bootstrap, or
    + get full source syntax-case up (Andre van Tonder?)
      https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-72/srfi-72.html, or
    + ... drop it?
* DONE
  - 0.22 GNU Mes now builds reproducibly cross-platform, runs on the
    Hurd and has better support for other distributions and kernels.
  - 0.21 GNU Mes now supports a Scheme-only bootstrap and is packaged in
    Debian GNU/Linux.
  - 0.20 GNU Mes brings the Reduced Binary Source bootstrap to Guix.
  - 0.19 GNU Mes now compiles TinyCC in ~8min and supports building Bash and
    GNU Tar.
  - 0.18 GNU Mes now supports GuixSD bootstrap (x86,x86_64) and has native
    x86_64 support.
  - 0.17.1 GNU Mes now allows removing glibc, binutils and gcc from the GuixSD
    bootstrap.
  - 0.17 GNU Mes is now an official GNU project and bootstraps gcc-4.7.4.
  - 0.16.1 Mes now has info docs and installs ootb on Debian buster/testing.
  - 0.16 Mes Lib C now bootstraps glibc-2.2.5, binutils-2.20.1, gcc-4.1.0.
  - 0.15: MesCC now has a libc+gnu that supports compiling binutils-2.14,
    gcc-2.95.3 and glibc-2.2.5.
  - 0.14: Mes+MesCC now compiles a slightly patched self-hosting tcc.
  - 0.13: Mes+MesCC now compiles a modified, functional tcc.c (~25,000LOC) in
    1h30'.
  - 0.12: Mes+MesCC now compiles mes.c (~3000LOC) in ~4min.
  - 0.11: MesCC now compiles a mes-tcc that passes 26/69 of mescc's C tests.
  - 0.10: Mescc now compiles a mes-tcc that compiles a trivial C to a running
    a.out.
  - 0.9: Mescc now writes M1 macro assembly files and compiles tcc.
  - 0.8: Mescc now writes object files in stage0's labeled hex2 format.
  - 0.7: Mescc supports -E, -c, -o options, include more complete set of
    header files, enough to work on compiling tinycc's tcc.c albeit a somewhat
    modified version.
  - 0.6: Work with unmodified, unbundled Nyacc; compile 33/55 tinycc's
    tests/test2 suite.
  - 0.5: Mutual self-hosting Scheme interpreter and C compiler: mes.c and
    mescc, Support call-with-current-continuation, refactor catch/throw
  - 0.4: Support Nyacc, Gcc-compiled Mes compiles minimal main.c using nyacc
  - 0.3: Garbage collector
  - 0.2: Support psyntax
  - 0.1: Mes eval/apply feature complete; support syntax-rules, compile main.c
    using LALR, dump ELF
