m /general _ _ _ General configuration
Settings for how you would like live-bootstrap to run.

o /general/timestamps FORCE_TIMESTAMPS bool False Zero timestamps at end
At the end of the bootstrap, set the timestamps of all files to 0 UNIX time.

o /general/swap SWAP_SIZE size 0 Swap size
The size of a swapfile to be created once swap is supported in live-bootsrap.
Intended for systems with low RAM.

o /general/kernel_bootstrap KERNEL_BOOTSTRAP bool True Use the kernel bootstrap
This only applies if you are not in a chroot-like environment. You should
already know whether you want this flag or not. If you booted using
builder-hex0, this flag should be true; if you booted using your own Linux
kernel, this flag should be false.

o /general/interactive INTERACTIVE bool True Drop to a shell post-bootstrap
At the end of the bootstrap, drop to a shell which you can do further things
in.

o /general/disk DISK "" _ [IMPORTANT] [DANGER] Disk
live-bootstrap needs a disk which the final system will be installed onto.
This should be in the form of the name of the device node, eg sda. If you
have externally downloaded sources or the like, place in here the device
node with the appropriate partition, eg sda1.
Disclaimer for bare metal users:
It is highly recommended that all disks other than this disk are removed
from the system to avoid accidental data loss. It is vital that you choose
this correctly, otherwise you risk overwriting an existing disk on your
system. LIVE-BOOTSTRAP TAKES NO LIABILITY FOR ANY DATA LOSS RESULTING FROM
ITS USE.

m /extras _ _ _ Extra bootstraps
Various extra language or package bootstraps that are not core to
live-bootstrap, but are an optional part of it.

o /extras/python EXTRA_PYTHON bool False Python bootstrap
Bootstraps Python.

m /sysinfo _ _ _ System information
Details about your specific system and the environment live-bootstrap is
running in.

o /sysinfo/chroot CHROOT bool False Chroot-like environment
Only set to True if live-bootstrap is running in a chroot-like environment.
This might be in a chroot, on bubblewrap, or similar. QEMU is not a
chroot-like environment.

o /sysinfo/baremetal BARE_METAL bool False Bare metal environment
Only set to True if live-bootstrap is running directly on bare metal, without
another kernel or virtualisation layer in between. A chroot, bubblewrap, or
QEMU is not bare metal.

o /sysinfo/jobs FINAL_JOBS int _ Number of jobs
The number of jobs that packages should be compiled with. A sensible value
would be the number of threads on your system.

o /sysinfo/arch ARCH "x86|amd64|riscv64" _ Architecture
The architecture live-bootstrap is running on.

m /sysinfo/internal _ _ _ [INTERNAL] Advanced configuration
Internal configuration. You should not touch this unless you know what you
are doing!

o /sysinfo/internal/ci INTERNAL_CI bool False Internal CI
If you are seeing this, it should not be set to true. (Flag for live-bootstrap
CI).

m /dev _ _ _ [DEV] Development options
Options intended for primarily live-bootstrap development or debugging.

o /dev/update_checksums UPDATE_CHECKSUMS bool False [DEV] Update checksums of packages
Rather than checking checksums of packages against the existing list, generate
a new list for the checksums of packages.

o /dev/build_kernels BUILD_KERNELS bool _ Build kernels
Even when they are not required, still build kernels/kernel adjacent packages.
This option has no effect when using KERNEL_BOOTSTRAP.
